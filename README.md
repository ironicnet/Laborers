========

So far, only code.

Started the creation of some behaviors:

+ Unit:
	+ The basic unit. It has a workplan consisting of different tasks.
+ Building:
	+ The base of a unit.
	+ A building has some requirements (recipe) to be built.
	+ When the requirements are met, it should start the building process. When the building process is done, the building is considered built.
